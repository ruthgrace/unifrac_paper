\section*{Introduction}
In 2005, Lozupone et al introduced the UniFrac distance metric, a measure to calculate the difference between microbiomes that incorporated phylogenetic distance \cite{lozupone2005unifrac}. The goal of UniFrac was to enable objective comparison between microbiome samples from different conditions. In 2007, Lozupone added a proportional weighting to the original unweighted method \cite{lozupone2007quantitative}. Since then, papers reporting these metrics have garnered over a thousand citations, and enabled research about everything from how kwashiorkor causes malnutrition \cite{smith2013gut} to how people can have similar microbiomes to their pet dogs \cite{song2013cohabiting}. Except for generalized UniFrac, used to make hybrid unweighted and weighted UniFrac comparisons \cite{chen2012associating}, few advances in the metric have occurred since 2007. In this paper we examine \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a data set where unweighted }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{data sets where }\DIFaddend UniFrac gives misleading results, and \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{present and }\DIFaddend discuss some alternative weightings for UniFrac.

\DIFaddbegin \paragraph{\DIFadd{Operational Taxonomic Units}}\DIFadd{\mbox{}}\\
\DIFadd{Unlike more distinct species, such as mammalian species, bacterial species are not well defined. Bacterial genomes are highly variable, and regions used to identify bacteria vary in a continuum rather than clusters of similar sequences.
}

\DIFadd{Historically bacteria that are have 97\% identity in a variable region are considered to be the same taxa \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{ciccarelli2006toward}}%DIFAUXCMD
. The 97\% cutoff was arbitrarily chosen to best map sequence data to bacterial classifications. This threshold is thought to maximizes the grouping of bacteria classified as the same species while minimizing the grouping of bacteria classified as different species \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{caporaso2011global}}%DIFAUXCMD
. Before sequencing bacterial classification was often done by appearance or by metabolic products, so there are outliers where bacteria classified in the same species are actually genetically very different, or bacteria classified in different genus are genetically very similar.
}

\DIFadd{However, it is difficult to determine how a batch of sequences should be partitioned into groups of 97\% identity. One way is to perform a clustering algorithm (using software such as UCLUST \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{edgar2010search}}%DIFAUXCMD
) that partitions the groups and then later assign taxonomic identity by matching the seed or central sequences with public databases, such as SILVA \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{quast2013silva}}%DIFAUXCMD
, the Ribosomal Database Project \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{cole2009ribosomal}}%DIFAUXCMD
, or Greengenes \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{desantis2006greengenes}}%DIFAUXCMD
. Another method is closed reference OTU picking, which starts off with seed sequences from known bacteria and perform the clustering such that the 97\% identity groups are centered on the seed sequences. In any case, the resulting taxonomic groupings are known as Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), and are used consistently within the same experiment. While OTUs can be annotated with standard taxonomic names such that results can be compared between experiments, technically the taxonomic groupings used by different experiments are not the same, except with closed reference OTUs, or individual sequence unit methods. Individual sequence unit (ISU) methods which do not use OTUs can be run with software such as DADA2 \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{callahan2015dada2}}%DIFAUXCMD
.
}

\DIFadd{Grouping of amplicon sequences into OTUs allows for the data to be summarized into a table of counts per OTU per sample.
}

\subsection{\DIFadd{Data}}
\DIFadd{UniFrac requires two pieces of information: phylogenetic tree and a table of counts per inferred taxa per sample. These are derived from a gene tag sequencing experiment, such as the commonly used 16S rRNA gene \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{tringe2008renaissance}}%DIFAUXCMD
. The sequenced gene contains a variable region, allowing the sequences to be grouped into OTUs as described in the previous section. A count table can then be generated with the number of reads per OTU per sample. The center sequence of each OTU group can be put into a multiple sequence alignment, from which a phylogenetic tree can be inferred.
}

\DIFadd{The phylogenetic tree is created through a multiple sequence alignment with the representative OTU sequences, using software such as MUSCLE \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{edgar2004muscle}}%DIFAUXCMD
, or using a guide tree, such as through Greengenes \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{desantis2006greengenes} }%DIFAUXCMD
or the QIIME software \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{caporaso2010qiime}}%DIFAUXCMD
. Each leaf of the tree represents one of the OTUs, and each of the branches of the tree has a length. Additionally, the tree needs to be rooted for the UniFrac calculation to be performed. This is often done by rooting the tree at its midpoint.
}

\subsection{\DIFadd{Compositional Data Analysis}}
\DIFadd{Microbiome data is in the form of a list of counts per feature (OTUs in this case), with the features composing an aspect of the microbiome for each sample. This is compositional data. There are several core truths about microbiome data and its compositional nature that should be considered when making an analysis strategy.
}

\DIFadd{First, the total number of reads per sample is influenced by sample collection, extraction, sequencing library preparation, and sequencing platform, and is irrelevant to the biological implications of the data. Additionally, the constraint of the count total causes the abundance of different taxa to appear to be negatively correlated with each other when analyzed by conventional statistics. When one taxa increases in abundance, the counts detected in other taxa decrease in abundance, even if the taxa are not decreasing in abundance biologically. For example, one study compared the microbiome of vaginal swab samples from women with bacterial vaginosis (BV), women without BV, and women with intermediate BV, using qPCR to quantify the taxa. }\textit{\DIFadd{Prevotella}} \DIFadd{was found to increase through non-BV to intermediate to BV, while }\textit{\DIFadd{Lactobacillus iners}} \DIFadd{stayed relatively the same. If the same samples were put through a gene tag sequencing experiment where the taxa could not be quantified and the total read counts were constrained, one might incorrectly conclude that the abundance }\textit{\DIFadd{Lactobacillus iners}} \DIFadd{was decreasing while }\textit{\DIFadd{Prevotella}} \DIFadd{was increasing.
}

\DIFadd{To prevent incorrect conclusions, data should be analyzed in a compositional way. In Euclidean space, data points can increase or decrease freely. Compositional data is under a sum constraint, and exist in a non-Euclidean space known as the Aitchison simplex \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{aitchison1982statistical}}%DIFAUXCMD
. A data transformation can be performed to put the data into Euclidean space, so that it can be analyzed with standard statistical methods that depend on Cartesian coordinates and linear relationships. These transformations involve examining the ratios of different OTU abundances to each other, so that the total number of reads do not unduly affect the result. In the example with bacterial vaginosis, using ratios of taxa to each other would elucidate the nature of the biological change in the data.
}

\DIFaddend \subsection{Unweighted UniFrac}
Unweighted UniFrac \cite{lozupone2005unifrac} uses an inferred evolutionary distance to measure similarity between samples. It requires a reference phylogenetic tree containing all the taxa present in the samples to be examined\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, plus information about which taxa were detected in each sample}\DIFaddend . The calculation is performed by dividing the branch lengths \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{that are not }\DIFaddend shared between the two samples by the branch lengths covered by either sample. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Figure ~\ref{fig1} shows example calcualtions for UniFrac based on the tree overlap. }\DIFaddend A distance of 0 means that the samples are identical, and a distance of 1 means that the two samples share no taxa in common.

When two samples do not share any branches of the phylogenetic tree, the unweighted UniFrac distance is maximized at 1. When two samples share half of their branch lengths on the phylogenetic tree, the unweighted UniFrac distance is 0.5. If the two samples contain exactly the same taxa, the unweighted UniFrac distance is minimized at 0, since the samples share all branches.}

\DIFaddend \subsection{Weighted UniFrac}
Weighted UniFrac \cite{lozupone2007quantitative} is an implementation of the Kantorovich–Rubinstein distance in mathematics, also known as the earth mover’s distance \cite{evans2012phylogenetic}. Rather than looking only at the presence or absence of taxa, each branch length of the phylogenetic tree is weighted by the difference in proportional abundance of the taxa between the two samples.

This technique reduces the problem of low abundance taxa being represented as a 0 or by a low count depending on sampling depth. In unweighted UniFrac, such taxa would flip from absent to present, and could skew the measurement: this would be especially problematic if the taxa are on a long branch. In weighted UniFrac, low abundance taxa have a much lower weight and so will have a lower impact on the total distance reported by the metric.

UniFrac is constituted as either a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{presence/absence }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{binary weighting }\DIFaddend (unweighted UniFrac) \cite{lozupone2005unifrac}, a linear proportion (weighted UniFrac) \cite{lozupone2007quantitative}, or some combination of the two (generalized UniFrac) \cite{chen2012associating}. However, \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{it is a misconception that }\DIFaddend the data are \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{not linear , }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{linear }\DIFaddend because the sum of the total number of reads is constrained by the sequencing machinery \cite{friedman2012inferring} \cite{fernandes2013anova} \cite{fernandes2014unifying} \cite{lovell2015proportionality}. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Microbiome communities can exhibit tremendous variation in their total bacterial count. For example, a stool sample may produce more highly concentrated DNA extract than a skin swab sample, resulting in different read count totals. Vaginal samples from patients with bacterial vaginosis compared to patients without can have total counts that differ one magnitude \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{zozaya2010quantitative}}%DIFAUXCMD
. }\DIFaddend Alternative weightings and non-linear transformations of data need to be explored. Furthermore, unweighted UniFrac is known to be unreliable, but it is not generally known or understood how this can impact results.

\subsection{Analytical techniques}

\paragraph{Rarefaction}\mbox{}\\
Rarefaction normalizes the samples OTU counts to a standard sequencing depth \cite{simberloff1978use}. This resulting table can be thought of as a random point estimate of the dataset, as the output is a sub-sample \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{without replacement }\DIFaddend of the original table. This standardization process is recommended by the authors of UniFrac \cite{de2011evaluation} in order to account for the sensitivity of UniFrac to sequencing depth.

Rarefactions can be performed using the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Qiime }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{QIIME }\DIFaddend software \cite{caporaso2010qiime} or using the vegan package in R \cite{oksanen2007vegan}.

\paragraph{Unweighted UniFrac}\mbox{}\\
Unweighted UniFrac is calculated based on the presence or absence of counts for each branch in the phylogenetic tree, when comparing two samples. A branch \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is unshared when one sample has a non-zero abundance but not the other, and a branch is shared when both samples }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{belongs to a sample when at least one of the OTUs in the leaves below it }\DIFaddend have a non-zero abundance. The formula for unweighted UniFrac is as follows, where $b$ is the set of branch lengths in the phylogenetic tree\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, $A$ and $B$ represent the two samples being compared, $\triangle$ is the symmetric difference between two sets, and $\cup$ is the union between two sets}\DIFaddend :

\begin{align*}
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\frac{\sum_{}{} b_{unshared}}{\sum_{}{} b_{unshared} + \sum_{}{} b_{shared}}
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Unweighted_{AB} = \frac{\sum_{}{} b_{A} \triangle b_{B}}{\sum_{}{} b_{A} \cup b_{B}}
}\DIFaddend \end{align*}

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The sum of the branch lengths that belong to one sample but not the other is divided by the sum of the branch lengths that belong to one or both samples.
}

\DIFaddend \paragraph{Weighted UniFrac}\mbox{}\\
Weighted UniFrac \cite{lozupone2007quantitative} also incorporates each branch length of the phylogenetic tree, and weights them according to proportional abundance of the two samples. The formula for weighed UniFrac is as follows, where $A$ and $B$ are the two samples, $b$ is the set of branch lengths, and $\frac{A_{i}}{A_{T}}$ and $\frac{B_{i}}{B_{T}}$ are the proportional abundances associated with branch length $b_{i}$:

\begin{align*}
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Weighted_{AB} = }\DIFaddend \sum_{i}^{n} b_{i} \times \left| \frac{A_{i}}{A_{T}} - \frac{B_{i}}{B_{T}} \right|
\end{align*}

\paragraph{Information UniFrac}\mbox{}\\
Information UniFrac is calculated by weighing each branch length by the difference in the uncertainty of the taxa abundance between the two samples. Uncertainty \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{information }\DIFaddend is calculated as follows, where p is the proportional abundance \cite{shannon2001mathematical}:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:schemeP} 
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{information = }\DIFaddend - p  \times log_{2}(p)
\end{equation}

If a sample is \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{composed of }\DIFaddend 50\% taxa A and 50\% taxa B, then the proportional abundances have maximum uncertainty about what taxa is likely to be seen in a given sequence read. If a sample is 80\% taxa A and 20\% taxa B, then there is less uncertainty, because a given sequence read is more likely to be taxa A. When the amount of uncertainty that a taxa has in one sample corresponds with the amount of uncertainty the same taxa has in a different sample, the abundance of that taxa is mutually informative between samples. Weighting UniFrac by uncertainty combines the the concept of uncertainty with phylogenetic relationships to identify taxa that are differentially informative between groups.

The formula for Information UniFrac is as follows:

\begin{align*}
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Information_{AB} = }\DIFaddend \sum_{i}^{n} b_{i} \times \left| \frac{A_{i}}{A_{T}}log\left(\frac{A_{i}}{A_{T}}\right) - \frac{B_{i}}{B_{T}}log\left(\frac{B_{i}}{B_{T}}\right) \right|
\end{align*}

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Information UniFrac approaches a minimum of zero (Fig.~\ref{fig5}) when a sample is composed of a monoculture. It also related to the Aitchison distance in compositional data analysis \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{egozcue2011evidence}}%DIFAUXCMD
.
}

\DIFaddend \paragraph{\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Centered }\DIFdelend Ratio UniFrac}\mbox{}\\
In complex microbiome communities, there \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{are very many }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{may be a large number of }\DIFaddend bacterial taxa with \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a low level of counts}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{few counts, such that the data is sparse}\DIFaddend . Taking the geometric mean of the proportional abundances of taxa in a microbiome sample represents an unbiased baseline \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of the average abundance of features with geometric growth characteristics - such as bacteria which divide by fission }\DIFaddend \cite{aitchison1982statistical}. Experiments generally do not have power to detect differences at abundances below the mean \cite{fernandes2013anova}. Centering the proportional abundances around the geometric mean thus allows one to examine the data in \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{this }\DIFaddend context, muting differences that are close to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{baseline }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the baseline abundance }\DIFaddend and accentuating outliers. The formula for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{centered }\DIFdelend ratio UniFrac is as follows, where $gm$ is the geometric mean:

\begin{align*}
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Ratio_{AB} = }\DIFaddend \sum_{i}^{n} b_{i} \times \left| \frac{\frac{A_{i}}{A_{T}}}{gm(A_{i})} - \frac{\frac{B_{i}}{B_{T}}}{{gm(B_{i})}} \right|
\end{align*}

Note that the geometric mean is calculated by combining all children in the subtree of $b_{i}$ into $\frac{A_{i}}{A_{T}}$ for sample $A$ or $\frac{B_{i}}{B_{T}}$ for sample $B$, and including the rest of the single taxa proportional abundances separately. The one combined proportional abundance and the remaining single taxa proportional abundances are input into the geometric mean formula, as set $a$:

\begin{align*}
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{gm(a) = }\DIFaddend \left( \prod_{i}^{n} a_{i}\right)^{1/n}
\end{align*}

One challenge when it comes to the analysis of read count data is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the presence of zero counts}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{that the data is very sparse}\DIFaddend . Whether a low-abundance taxa \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{or feature }\DIFaddend appears in the data as a zero or a low positive count is up to chance, and assuming that a zero count represents the absence of a taxa can be very misleading \cite{fernandes2013anova}. A Bayesian approach can be used to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{estimate the likelihood that a zerocould be changed to a positive count if the sample were resequenced, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{give a posterior estimate of the likelihood for zero: this is }\DIFaddend implemented by the cmultRepl command in the zCompositions package in R \cite{palarea2015zcompositions}.

The use of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{this }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ratio }\DIFaddend weighting for UniFrac produces measurements that violate the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{metric }\DIFaddend triangle inequality, such that Euclidean statistics are technically invalid. Thus this \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{metric}\DIFaddend , like the Bray-Curtis metric, is a dissimilarity, not a distance.

For this paper, we calculate UniFrac metrics using a custom R script, which includes unweighted UniFrac, weighted UniFrac, information UniFrac, and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{centered }\DIFdelend ratio UniFrac: \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{https://github.com/ruthgrace/exponentUnifrac/blob/master/UniFrac.r

\paragraph{Bray-Curtis dissimilarity metric}\mbox{}\\
The Bray Curtis dissimilarity metric \cite{beals1984bray} quantifies how dissimilar two sites are based on counts. A \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Bray-Curtis }\DIFaddend index of 0 means that two samples are identical, while a \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Bray-Curtis }\DIFaddend index of 1 means samples do not share any species. It is computed as a proportion through the formula:

\begin{align*}
C_{ij} &= 1 - \frac{2C_{ij}}{S_{i} + S_{j}} \\
\text{where}~C_{ij}&= \text{dissimilarity index bound by [0,1]} \\
  S_{i} &= \text{Specimen counts at site i} \\
  S_{j} &= \text{Specimen counts at site j} \\
\end{align*}

\subsection{Unweighted Unifrac is highly sensitive to rarefaction \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{variants}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{instance}\DIFaddend }

A commentary by Lozupone et al. 2011 \cite{lozupone2011unifrac} addressed the sensitivity of Unweighted UniFrac to sampling. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{They utilized }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Lozupone's group used }\DIFaddend mean UniFrac values to compute a confidence ellipse \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{between the first and third quartile}\DIFaddend . However, we observed that this approach under-represented the true variability of unweighted UniFrac as a distance metric by highlighting how individual samples vary. In the absence of true differences and in the presence of uneven sampling, unweighted UniFrac can be sensitive to rarefaction \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{variants}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{instances}\DIFaddend . We show this by analyzing two rarefactions of the same body site with the rationale that if there is no true difference in the data, separation of these samples should not be observed.

Note that the variance explained in the tongue data set by the first and second coordinate is merely 16.1\% and 9.8\% respectively, indicating that the data is rather spherical, even though the points on the plot appear to show two separated clusters (compare with 32.6\% and 16.2\% in the tongue dorsum vs. buccal mucosa data set).

Rare OTUs with less than }\DIFaddend 100 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{counts across samples}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{total counts across all the samples were removed}\DIFaddend . The minimum sample count for the subset of 60 we analyzed was 659, therefore we rarefied (subsampled) to the minimum of 659 to normalize the samples\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, prior to performing a principal coordinates analysis (PCoA)}\DIFaddend . For Fig.~\ref{fig2}, two independent rarefactions of the data were conducted in order to observe the effect of rarefaction \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{variants on the metrics}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{instance on the metric}\DIFaddend . The unweighted UniFrac distance was \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{then }\DIFdelend computed for each rarefaction, and Procrustes adjustment was applied in order to overlay the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{PCoA-derived }\DIFaddend second rarefaction onto the first. A \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{PCA }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{PCoA }\DIFaddend of rarefaction 1 was plotted, and any samples that changed between rarefactions one and two were visualized with red and blue on the plot. If the sample moved from one \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cluster to another between the rarefactions}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{side of the first coordinate axis to the other between the rarefaction instances}\DIFaddend , it was indicated with either a blue or a red arrow. 

In both rarefactions on Fig.~\ref{fig2}, samples separated distinctly into two clusters on principal coordinate 1. Principal coordinate 1 explains the most variation in the data, and is thus useful to visualize if any associated metadata is behind the sample separation. However, the separation was not explainable by any metadata associated with the HMP experiment, and is thus an undesirable result. When plotting the rarefactions against each other, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{various }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{several }\DIFaddend samples are observed \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{moving between the various clusters}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{to be unstable, exhibiting large differences in location}\DIFaddend . This example demonstrates that samples with little difference can appear to be different through the unweighted UniFrac distance metric \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and that rarefaction can lead to misleading and non-reproducible results}\DIFaddend .

\subsection{\DIFadd{The cause of rarefaction variation by Unweighted Unifrac}}
\DIFaddend One point to note is that rarefaction carries the assumption that microbiota within samples are homogeneous and randomly distributed. However, this assumption is only valid if proper sampling protocols are observed \cite{gorzelak2015methods}. A combination of unevenly sampled \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{genes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{OTUs }\DIFaddend and distantly related \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{genes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{OTUs }\DIFaddend will contribute to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{UniFrac's variability when genes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the variability in unweighted UniFrac when OTUs }\DIFaddend are ultimately rarefied. Distance matrices between samples will be affected when rare \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{genes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{OTUs }\DIFaddend are left out during the rarefaction processes. It becomes intuitive to see how similar samples may grow dissimilar from each other through unweighted UniFrac on rarefied samples as the number of unshared branches increases as \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{genes disappear}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{OTUs are removed}\DIFaddend .

\DIFdel{With rare genes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{With rare OTUs }\DIFaddend and long branch lengths in the phylogenetic tree (Fig.~\ref{fig4}), the Unweighted UniFrac distance metric on rarefied data is highly variable, declaring the samples A and B identical (distance of 0) with 1 rarefaction, and different with another (distance of 0.4175), as demonstrated in Table ~\ref{table1} and the calculations above.

While an improvement on unweighted UniFrac, weighted UniFrac can overweight differences between large proportional abundances and underweight differences between small proportional abundances. If one bacterial taxa increased in proportion from 5/1000 to 10/1000 and another taxa increased in proportion from 95/1000 to 100/1000, they would have the same weight in weighted UniFrac. However, the first taxa has doubled in proportion between samples, and this is much more biologically significant than the change in proportional abundance in the second taxa. Additionally, it does not account for how the counts add up to a constrained sum determined by the sequencing machine model. Because the sum is constrained, as \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{an example}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{with the bacterial vaginosis sample earlier}\DIFaddend , an increase in growth of one taxa can make the data look like there is a decrease in abundance in other taxa, even if in reality the population of the other taxa stayed the same.

Here we explore some alternatives to unweighted and weighted UniFrac, and discuss their merits and shortfalls.

We next explore two other datasets, one with a defined difference between groups (tongue dorsum compared to buccal mucosa), and one with an outlier that is only apparent when analyzed by certain dissimilarity metrics.

Fig.~\ref{fig6} shows a principal coordinate analysis plot with four different metrics: unweighted UniFrac, weighted UniFrac, information UniFrac, and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{centered }\DIFdelend ratio UniFrac. We observe that the difference in the microbiome between the human tongue and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cheek }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{buccal mucosa }\DIFaddend are well defined by all metrics (Fig.~\ref{fig6}), since all of the weightings show separation between the samples according to body site. We conclude \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{from (Fig.~\ref{fig3}) }\DIFaddend that weighted UniFrac, information UniFrac, and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{centered }\DIFdelend ratio UniFrac do not tend to show spurious separation in uniform data sets to the degree that unweighted UniFrac does\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(Fig.~\ref{fig3})}\DIFdelend , while reliably separating samples in data with a defined difference between groups.

Fig.~\ref{fig7} is a principal coordinate analysis of a 16S rRNA gene sequencing experiment done on microbiome samples from breast milk \cite{urbaniak2016human}. Breast milk samples were collected and the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced. One of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{these samples was infected (circled), consisting }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the patients who provided a sample had an active infection, producing a sample that consisted }\DIFaddend of 97\% Pasteurella. We noted that this sample was not distinct in unweighted and weighted UniFrac because the distance from the Pasteurella branches of the phylogenetic tree to the root of the tree (rooted by midpoint) were not particularly short or long, measuring at just over the 3rd quartile of all root-to-leaf distances. In addition, the Pasteurella leaves shared a clade with many other taxa.

The reason the infected sample in the breast milk study is so distinct from the rest of the samples in Information UniFrac and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Centered }\DIFdelend Ratio UniFrac is because of the weighting. The infected sample was 97\% Pasteurella, while the other samples generally had 15-20\% each of Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas, and little or no Pasteurella. Unweighted UniFrac does not differentiate between high and low abundance. Weighted UniFrac does, placing the infected sample in the bottom right corner of that plot. Information UniFrac weights everything in the infected sample close to zero, as taxa are present in either very high or very low abundance, while weighting Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas in the other samples highly (around 0.4) due to their 15-20\% abundance. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Centered ratio }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Ratio }\DIFaddend UniFrac recognizes that the infected sample has a taxonomic abundance very far from the geometric mean abundance. For these reasons information and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{centered }\DIFdelend ratio UniFrac are more adept at picking up outliers with uneven distributions, even if the taxa are shared by other samples.

\subsection{\DIFadd{Monoculture data}}

\label{fig8}
\end{figure}

\DIFadd{Each sample in the monoculture dataset is 97\% dominated by one of three taxa. However, within the remaining 3\% there is variation in the counts.
}

\DIFadd{Unweighted UniFrac, being binary test, detects only the variation in the remaining 3\% of counts, without showing the difference in the monocultures. Weighted UniFrac detects only the difference in the identity of the monoculture, and the separation is driven by phylogenetic distance - the pairwise distance from }\textit{\DIFadd{Pasteurella}} \DIFadd{to }\textit{\DIFadd{Staphylococcus}} \DIFadd{and }\textit{\DIFadd{Pseudomonas}} \DIFadd{to }\textit{\DIFadd{Staphylococcus}} \DIFadd{is just over 0.9 on the phylogenetic tree while the distance from }\textit{\DIFadd{Pasteurella}} \DIFadd{to }\textit{\DIFadd{Pseudomonas}} \DIFadd{is 0.45. This is in correspondence with the PCoA plot where the first coordinate (which separates the }\textit{\DIFadd{Staphylococcus}} \DIFadd{species from the other two) explains over 90\% of the variance in the data set.
}

\DIFadd{Information UniFrac is known to not perform very well for monocultures, due to taxa with very high and low proportional abundances having uncertainty information values close to zero (Fig.~\ref{fig5}). While the samples separate visually with information UniFrac, the variance explained by the separation is low, and the distance matrix does not separate the three groups by hierarchical clustering. Ratio UniFrac and Bray Curtis both separate the samples by monoculture, and also differentiate the samples by their minor variations, showcasing a more representative perspective of this data set.
}

\DIFadd{If the samples are hierarchically clustered, the three groups separate perfectly with weighted UniFrac, ratio UniFrac, and  Bray Curtis dissimilarity, but not with unweighted UniFrac or information UniFrac.

\DIFaddend \section*{Discussion}
As shown in the tongue and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cheek }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{buccal mucosa }\DIFaddend data set, unweighted UniFrac is perfectly sufficient for data sets with a notable difference. However, in data sets with no difference or a very small difference between groups such the uniform tongue dorsum data set, unweighted UniFrac is the least reliable and we found that it may produce wildly different results depending on rarefaction and sequencing depth. This can result in spurious groups, or inclusion of samples in the wrong groups.

We found weighted UniFrac, information UniFrac, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{centered }\DIFdelend ratio UniFrac, and Bray-Curtis methods to be more reliable choices. We suggest that investigators use several methods as they can detect outliers in different circumstances. When an outlier is detected by any metric, an investigation is warranted, as with our example in the breast milk data set.

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We do not believe that any of these weightings are a perfect model for microbiome data. Each tool is prone to its own set of weaknesses. If the difference in groups is driven by presence/absence then UniFrac is a reasonable choice. If the difference is driven by a linear abundance, then weighted UniFrac is a good choice. Information UniFrac and ratio UniFrac are useful for examining data sets that contain the similar sets of taxa between groups. Ratio UniFrac is especially good for examining data sets that have more subtle variations, due to its non linear nature. In any case, inspection should be done to make sure that the tool used accurately represents the data.
}

\DIFaddend In summary, with the addition of information UniFrac and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{centered }\DIFdelend ratio UniFrac, biologists have more tools at their disposal to prevent spurious interpretations, detect outliers, and ultimately understand their data better.
